DESCRIPTION: Formalize theory and research hypothesis
================================================================================

PROMPT:
You have access to the literature review outputs in files/research_notes/. Read ALL evidence_sheet files (evidence_sheet.json, evidence_sheet_gnn.json from anomaly detection and financial reviews). Synthesize findings into a unified mathematical framework for "GNNs for Financial Anomaly Detection". Define: (1) the problem formulation with graph construction G=(V,E) where V=accounts and E=transactions; (2) theoretical foundations from GNN literature; (3) a formal hypothesis about when heterophily-aware GNNs outperform homophily-assuming ones in financial networks; (4) key assumptions (temporal dynamics, anomaly prevalence 0.1-2%, class imbalance); (5) falsifiable predictions with quantitative thresholds (e.g., "heterophily-aware methods achieve F1 > 0.90 on financial graphs"). Write comprehensive pseudocode for the experimental validation strategy. Save all outputs to files/theory/framework.md and files/theory/hypothesis.md.

SPAWNED: 2025-12-24 03:34:41
DESCRIPTION: Design comprehensive experiment plan
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Read files/research_notes/evidence_sheet.json (all three versions) and files/theory/ (framework.md and hypothesis.md). Design a rigorous ExperimentPlan JSON that specifies: (1) PRIMARY EXPERIMENT: Compare homophily-assuming GNNs (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) vs. heterophily-aware GNNs (H2GCN, FAGCN, LINKX, GPR-GNN) across synthetic financial graphs with systematically varying homophily levels h in {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. (2) ABLATION STUDIES: Isolate impact of temporal weighting, class imbalance handling (SMOTE ratios), and node feature importance. (3) ROBUSTNESS CHECKS: Vary graph sizes, anomaly prevalence rates (0.1%, 0.5%, 2%), label noise (FNR, FPR). (4) DATA GUIDELINES: Prefer synthetic Stochastic Block Model graphs for controlled homophily, with optional real datasets (Elliptic, FinBench) for validation. Organize as JSON with parameter_grids, ablation_studies, robustness_checks sections. Save to files/theory/experiment_plan.json. Include data_guidelines field specifying graph construction, feature engineering, and evaluation protocols.

SPAWNED: 2025-12-24 03:37:23
DESCRIPTION: Locate and document financial network datasets

PROMPT:
Read files/theory/experiment_plan.json to understand data guidelines. Your task: (1) Locate and evaluate the Elliptic Bitcoin transaction dataset and IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. Assess availability, licensing, node/edge counts, feature dimensions, anomaly prevalence, and homophily characteristics. (2) Document why synthetic Stochastic Block Model graphs are REQUIRED for primary experiments (systematic homophily control h ∈ [0.1, 0.5]). (3) Record access instructions for real datasets (Kaggle links, paper supplements, institutional repositories). (4) If real datasets have limitations, justify synthetic data generation strategy with specific parameters. (5) Create files/data/dataset_inventory.json with complete specifications (node counts, edge counts, features, anomaly%, homophily estimates, splits, access URLs). (6) Create files/data/README.md documenting dataset selection rationale, feature engineering guidelines, and temporal/graph construction details for reproducibility.

DESCRIPTION: Analyze results and test hypotheses
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Read files/results/results_table.json, files/theory/experiment_plan.json, and files/research_notes/evidence_sheet.json.

(3) Create detailed comparison JSONs: files/results/comparison_homophily_effect.json (F1 deltas between heterophily-aware vs. homophily-assuming at each h level with statistical significance), files/results/comparison_model_robustness.json (which models degrade under noise/imbalance). (4) If ANY hypothesis is falsified, create files/results/followup_plan.json with mode: "discovery" and 2-3 diagnostic follow-up hypotheses to explain the falsification. (5) Write comprehensive analysis to files/results/analysis_summary.md with tables, visualizations descriptions, interpretation of findings relative to prior work, and practical recommendations for practitioners. Include discussion of why results differ from literature expectations (evidence_sheet predicted F1 0.75-0.99, but some models underperform).
