DESCRIPTION: GNN architectures and theory
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Survey foundational graph neural network architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GIN) and theoretical properties. Focus on node/edge/graph-level learning, message passing, and scalability. MUST create evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence including model parameters, complexity bounds, and key performance metrics from benchmark papers.

DESCRIPTION: Anomaly detection methods using GNNs
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Research anomaly detection techniques applied to graph-structured data: graph autoencoders, graph outlier detection, unsupervised GNN methods, and reconstruction-based anomaly scoring. Include node anomalies, subgraph anomalies, and temporal graph anomalies. MUST create evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence from published papers including detection rates, false positive rates, and AUC scores.

DESCRIPTION: GNNs in financial fraud detection
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Survey applications of graph neural networks to financial crime detection: transaction graph anomalies, money laundering detection, fraud rings, and illicit financial networks. Include real-world case studies and regulatory contexts. MUST create evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence including fraud detection precision, recall, datasets used, and transaction volumes studied.

DESCRIPTION: Benchmarks and datasets for graph anomaly detection
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Identify public datasets and benchmarks for graph anomaly detection: synthetic transaction networks, graph classification benchmarks, and financial datasets. Include evaluation protocols, baselines, and baseline model performance. MUST create evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence: dataset sizes, anomaly rates, baseline accuracies, and computational requirements.
