  "bottom_line": "The extended experiments successfully address reviewer concerns about sample size (n=2->5) and training duration (200->5000 episodes), but they REJECT the undertraining hypothesis. This is a negative result that fundamentally changes the paper's interpretation. The finding is valuable: it shows that a promising approach (RL for QEC) faces unexpected fundamental limitations at scale, not just implementation issues. Recommend reframing manuscript accordingly and proposing diagnostic follow-ups (H1-H3) to understand the failure modes."
