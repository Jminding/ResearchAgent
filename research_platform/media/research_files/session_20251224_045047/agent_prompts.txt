DESCRIPTION: GNN architectures and theory
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Research foundational graph neural network architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN) and their theoretical properties. Focus on node embedding techniques, graph convolution mechanisms, and scalability. MUST create files/research_notes/evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence including: model parameters, computational complexity, benchmark accuracy numbers, and citation counts for key papers.

DESCRIPTION: Anomaly detection methods using GNNs
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Survey anomaly detection techniques applied to graphs: subgraph anomalies, node anomalies, edge anomalies, and community-based methods. Examine GNN-based detectors (outlier scoring, reconstruction loss, adversarial). Focus on methods for dynamic/streaming graphs. MUST create files/research_notes/evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence including: detection rates, false positive rates, F1 scores, and method-specific performance metrics from published benchmarks.

DESCRIPTION: Financial transaction networks and fraud
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Investigate financial transaction networks as graphs, money laundering detection, fraud ring identification, and behavioral anomalies in payment systems. Research graph-based fraud detection benchmarks and real-world financial datasets. MUST create files/research_notes/evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence including: fraud detection precision/recall, transaction network sizes, graph densities, known fraud prevalence rates, and detection latency requirements.

SPAWNED: 2025-12-24 04:50:57
DESCRIPTION: Benchmarks and open challenges
================================================================================

PROMPT:
Compile benchmarks for GNN-based anomaly detection: datasets (COLLAB, OGB, synthetic), performance metrics, baseline comparisons. Document open challenges: class imbalance, concept drift, scalability limits, interpretability. MUST create files/research_notes/evidence_sheet.json with quantitative evidence including: dataset statistics (nodes, edges, anomaly ratios), baseline method performances, computational costs, and reported limitations from literature.
