  "interpretation": "RL shows mean improvement of 26.2% across all distances (d=3,5,7,11,15), but this is NOT statistically significant at alpha=0.01 level (p=0.05). Critical issue: At d=15 (primary target), RL achieves NEGATIVE improvement (-6.7%), failing the core scaling hypothesis. While RL excels at small distances (d=3-7 with 30-57% improvement), it catastrophically fails at d>=11, performing worse than MWPM baseline at d=15. The 95% CI includes negative values, indicating high uncertainty. Hypothesis NOT supported.",
