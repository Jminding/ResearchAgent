Key findings: (1) Contrastive learning methods (EAGLE, ANEMONE) now outperform reconstruction-based methods by ~15%, achieving AUC 0.88-0.95 and F1 0.85-0.97. (2) Supervised methods achieve highest performance (F1 0.85-0.99) but require extensive labeled data. (3) Semi-supervised methods provide practical balance with F1 0.80-0.95 using 1-10% labeled data. (4) Critical pitfall: F1-score sensitivity to contamination rate requires careful evaluation protocol design. (5) Computational scaling degrades significantly above 1500 feature dimensions. (6) State-of-art methods leverage multiple techniques: Transformers for temporal dependencies, multi-view contrastive learning for representation robustness, and hybrid architectures combining multiple GNN types. (7) Open challenges: interpretability, threshold selection, dynamic graphs, and multi-type anomaly detection. Research shows trend toward deeper theoretical understanding and practical hybrid approaches.",
