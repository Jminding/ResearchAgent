================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY (FOR QUICK REFERENCE)
================================================================================

Architecture Efficiency Ranking:
1. GCN: O(|E|F) - Most efficient, limited expressiveness
2. GraphSAGE: O(bkL) - Balanced efficiency and inductive capability
3. GAT: O(N²) - Most expressive, prohibitive at scale
4. SIGN: O(|E|F) with precomputation - Scales to 100M+ nodes
5. SMPNN: O(n) - Linear scaling, recent (2025)

Dataset-Dependent Rankings:
- Small graphs (< 20K): GAT > GCN > GraphSAGE (accuracy-focused)
- Medium graphs (20K-1M): GraphSAGE > GAT > GCN (inductive focus)
- Large graphs (1M+): SIGN/SMPNN > GraphSAGE > GCN/GAT (scalability)

Accuracy Benchmarks:
- Best transductive: GAT 83.3% (Cora)
- Best inductive: GraphSAGE 90.7% (Cora)
- Large-scale: GAT 87.47% (ogbn-proteins), SIGN 82% (110M nodes)

Computational Bounds:
- Time: O(|E|F) for GCN, O(bkL) for GraphSAGE, O(N²) for GAT
- Memory full-batch: O(Lnd + Ld²) prohibitive > 1M nodes
- Memory mini-batch: O(bkL) scales independently of graph size

Practical Recommendations:
- Graphs < 100K: Any method viable; tuning matters more than architecture
- Graphs 100K-1M: GraphSAGE preferred for inductive; mini-batch GAT for accuracy
- Graphs 1M+: SIGN or SMPNN essential
- Depth: 2-4 layers optimal; up to 8-16 with proper regularization (batch norm, DropEdge)

Critical Success Factors:
- Regularization (dropout, batch norm) > architecture choice
- Hyperparameter tuning (especially dropout rate)
- Dataset size determines optimal architecture
- Transductive vs. inductive setting critical distinction

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Survey Status: COMPLETE

This comprehensive literature survey provides:
1. Structured research notes for formal paper inclusion
2. Quantitative evidence sheet for experimental design
3. Detailed technical analysis with practical guidance
4. 26 peer-reviewed sources with extracted findings
5. Research gap identification for future work

The survey establishes current consensus (2025):
- Classical GNNs (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) remain highly relevant
- No single "best" architecture; trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness
- Message-passing fundamentally superior to attention at scale
- Over-smoothing and over-squashing are fundamental challenges
- Regularization and hyperparameter tuning often more important than architecture

All materials are production-ready for use in formal research papers and downstream experimental design systems.
