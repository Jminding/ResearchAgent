CRITICAL OBSERVATION: Citation network benchmarks show saturation. Improvements
have stalled at ±1-2% per 7 years, suggesting these datasets are too small
(<1K labeled training samples) for meaningful differentiation.

---

LARGE-SCALE BENCHMARKS (Open Graph Benchmark)
---
ogbn-arxiv (169K nodes | 1.17M edges)
  GCN:  71.7%

ogbn-products (2.45M nodes | 61.86M edges)
  GraphSAGE: 82.5%

ogbn-papers100M (111M nodes | 1.57B edges)
  GraphSAGE: ~70% (requires sampling)
  Training: Billion-scale edges feasible with sampling

SAMPLING ACCURACY RETENTION:
  Mini-batch with neighbor sampling (S=10-25): 95-98% vs full-batch
  This enables 100-1000× speedup for large graphs

================================================================================
COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
================================================================================

TIME COMPLEXITY PER LAYER
---
GCN (full-batch):           O(|E|F + |V|F²)
  For sparse graphs |E|~|V|: O(|V|F²)
  For dense graphs |E|~|V|²: O(|V|²F)

GraphSAGE (neighbor sampling):  O(S^L × L × F²)
  where S = sample size per layer (typical 10-25)
  Example: S=15, L=2, |V|=1M → ~1.25M ops/epoch
  vs full GCN: ~10^12 ops → 10^6× speedup

GAT (attention aggregation):    O(|E|F'²)
  Attention overhead: 4× vs GCN
  For dense graphs: prohibitive beyond ~100K nodes

GIN (with MLP aggregation):     O(|V|F² + MLP_cost)
  MLP aggregation adds 2-3× overhead vs sum

---

SPACE COMPLEXITY
---
Adjacency matrix:
  Sparse (COO/CSR): O(|E|)
  Dense: O(|V|²)

Node features during forward pass:
  Per layer: O(|V| × F)
  All layers (for backprop): O(|V| × F × L)

Optimization state (Adam optimizer):
  2× parameters for 1st and 2nd moments

Example memory footprint:
  1M nodes, F=64, L=3: ~192M floats = 768 MB (full-batch)
  vs mini-batch (10K nodes): ~7.68 MB (99.8% reduction)

---

PARAMETER COUNTS
---
GCN on Cora (1433→64→7):        ~120K parameters
  GCN is parameter-efficient (no attention overhead)

GAT typical (F→256×K→output):   ~280K parameters
  3-4× more than GCN due to multi-head attention

GraphSAGE (mean aggregator):    ~200K parameters
  Moderate overhead from aggregation MLP

GIN (with MLPs):                ~400K parameters
  MLP per node increases parameters vs sum aggregation

---

PRACTICAL SCALABILITY LIMITS
---
Without sampling:
  <10K nodes:   Feasible on GPU
  10K-100K:     Feasible, mini-batch training
  >100K:        Problematic (memory/time), requires sampling

With neighbor sampling (S=10-25):
  <10K nodes:   Trivial (sampling overhead)
  100K-1M:      Feasible
  1M-100M:      Feasible
  >100M:        Feasible with careful engineering

Example: ogbn-papers100M (111M nodes, 1.57B edges) trainable with GraphSAGE

================================================================================
RECEPTIVE FIELD AND DEPTH ANALYSIS
================================================================================

RECEPTIVE FIELD GROWTH
---
Layer 1: Each node sees ~avg_degree neighbors
Layer 2: Each node sees ~avg_degree² nodes (neighborhood explosion)
Layer 3: Each node sees ~avg_degree³ nodes

Example (avg_degree = 50):
  L=1: ~50 neighbors
  L=2: ~2,500 neighbors
  L=3: ~125,000 neighbors ← exceeds many entire datasets

EMPIRICAL DEPTH PERFORMANCE (Cora dataset)
---
1 layer:  ~75%  (underfitting: missing context)
2 layers: ~81%  (OPTIMAL: best balance)
3 layers: ~80%  (acceptable: ±0-2% vs 2-layer)
4 layers: ~78%  (degradation: -2% vs 2-layer)
5 layers: ~70%  (severe: -11% vs 2-layer)

OVER-SMOOTHING MECHANISM
---
Root cause: Iterative aggregation resembles Laplacian diffusion (heat equation)
  - Node features gradually spread across entire graph
  - All nodes converge toward similar embeddings
  - Loss of node distinctiveness

Evidence: Cosine similarity of node embeddings increases with depth
  Layer 1: ~0.2 similarity (diverse)
  Layer 2: ~0.4 similarity (moderate)
  Layer 3: ~0.6 similarity (converging)
  Layer 4: ~0.85 similarity (high redundancy)

PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATION: Use 2-3 layers despite theoretical ability to stack
deeper. Skip connections and normalization only partially mitigate over-smoothing.

================================================================================
AGGREGATION FUNCTION EXPRESSIVENESS
================================================================================

MATHEMATICAL RANKING (based on injectivity on multisets)
---
1. SUM AGGREGATION (INJECTIVE - Most Expressive)
   Property: Different multisets → Different sums
   Equivalence: Weisfeiler-Lehman test power
   Cost: O(n) time
   Issue: Numerical instability with large neighborhoods

   Formula: ⊕_sum({x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}) = Σ xᵢ

2. ATTENTION AGGREGATION (INJECTIVE with learning)
   Property: Learned weights can maintain distinctness
   Advantage: Adaptive neighbor importance
   Cost: O(n²F') time (high)
   Issue: 4× overhead vs GCN; noisy patterns

   Formula: ⊕_attn({x₁, ..., xₙ}) = Σ αᵢ·xᵢ  (αᵢ learned)

3. MEAN/MAX AGGREGATION (NON-INJECTIVE)
   Property: Loses neighborhood cardinality info (mean) or diversity (max)
   Advantage: Efficient O(n) time, stable
   Issue: Less expressive than sum

   Formulas:
   ⊕_mean({x₁, ..., xₙ}) = (1/n) Σ xᵢ
   ⊕_max({x₁, ..., xₙ}) = max_i xᵢ

EMPIRICAL TRADE-OFF TABLE
---
Aggregation    Expressiveness    Speed    Stability    Typical Use
Sum            Highest           Fastest  Medium       Theory (GIN)
Attention      High              Slow     Low          Heterophilic graphs (GAT)
Mean           Medium            Fast     High         Practice (GCN, default)
Max            Medium            Fast     Medium       Pooling layers

================================================================================
SAMPLING EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY
================================================================================

SAMPLING STRATEGY PERFORMANCE
---
Neighbor sampling size S per layer (typical values: 5-25):

  S=25 per layer:
    Mini-batch time: ~1-2 seconds (1M nodes)
    Accuracy retention: 98% vs full-batch
    Memory: <10GB (vs >100GB full-batch)
    Used in: Reddit, Products benchmarks

  S=15 per layer:
    Mini-batch time: ~0.5 seconds (1M nodes)
    Accuracy retention: 96% vs full-batch
    Memory: <5GB
    Sweet spot for large graphs

  S=5 per layer:
    Mini-batch time: ~0.1 seconds (1M nodes)
    Accuracy retention: 92-95% vs full-batch
    Memory: <1GB
    For extreme scale (>100M nodes)

THEORETICAL RECEPTIVE FIELD WITH SAMPLING
---
Full aggregation L layers: |V| nodes reachable
With sampling S per layer:
  Effective receptive field: S^L nodes
  Example: S=15, L=2 → 225 nodes (vs all nodes with full agg)

PRACTICAL IMPACT
---
GraphSAGE on 1M nodes with S=15, L=2:
  Operations/epoch: 1.25M (vs 10^12 for full GCN)
  Speedup: 10^6× (10,000,000×)
  Accuracy loss: 1-2% vs full-batch
  Memory savings: 100-1000×

================================================================================
KNOWN PITFALLS AND LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. OVER-SMOOTHING (Primary depth limitation)
   - Node representations converge beyond 2-3 layers
   - Performance degrades significantly at L=4+
   - Root cause: Laplacian smoothing (iterative diffusion)
   - Mitigation: Skip connections, normalization (partial)

2. DEPTH PARADOX
   - Deeper networks (>3 layers) typically perform worse
   - Theoretical advantage (larger receptive field) unrealized
   - Practical networks use 2-3 layers despite ability to stack

3. NEIGHBORHOOD EXPLOSION
   - Full neighborhood grows exponentially with depth
   - For avg_degree=50: layer 3 would see 125K neighbors
   - Mitigated by sampling but introduces approximation

4. HETEROPHILY ASSUMPTION
   - Standard GNNs assume homophilic graphs (similar neighbors)
   - Citation networks are homophilic (papers cite similar work)
   - Performance collapses on heterophilic data (60-70% vs 80-85%)
   - GAT partially addresses via adaptive weighting

5. BENCHMARK SATURATION
   - Citation networks (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) show 1-2% progress per 7 years
   - Only ~1K labeled training samples; too small for meaningful differentiation
   - Saturation suggests ceiling ~85% on Cora, ~75% on CiteSeer
   - Shift needed to larger benchmarks (OGB datasets)

6. SMALL GRAPH OVERFITTING
   - Citation networks: <10K total nodes, ~1K labeled
   - High variance in results (±1-3% depending on random seed)
   - Requires multiple runs with confidence intervals

7. TRANSFER LEARNING GAP
   - No large pre-training corpus for graphs (unlike vision/NLP)
   - Limited transfer learning between different graph domains
   - Self-supervised pre-training emerging but not mainstream

8. AGGREGATION BOTTLENECK
   - Simple sum/mean may limit expressiveness for some tasks
   - Non-injective aggregation (mean, max) lose information
   - Attention fixes this but at 4× computational cost

9. SPARSE VS DENSE TRADE-OFF
   - Sparse adjacency matrices save memory (O(|E|) vs O(|V|²))
   - But complicate attention computation (irregular access patterns)
   - Dense representation needed for GAT, prohibitive for large graphs

10. GENERALIZATION BEYOND WEISFEILER-LEHMAN
    - GNNs fundamentally limited by WL test expressiveness
    - Cannot distinguish non-isomorphic graphs that WL cannot distinguish
    - Some graph properties provably unlearnable by MPNNs

11. MINI-BATCH DEGRADATION
    - Sampling introduces ~1-2% accuracy loss vs full-batch
    - Loss increases with sparser sampling
    - Trade-off: accuracy vs scalability

12. SAMPLING BIAS
    - Uniform random sampling may miss rare but important structures
    - High-degree nodes dominate sampled neighborhoods
    - Importance sampling variants proposed (not standardized)

13. ATTENTION COMPUTATION COST
    - GAT scales as O(|E|F'²), 4× overhead vs GCN
    - Prohibitive for dense graphs (>1M nodes)
    - Attention mechanism itself adds variance/instability

14. RECEPTIVE FIELD COVERAGE
    - Fixed sample size S per layer biased toward high-degree nodes
    - Skew in representation of different node types
    - Locality assumption may not hold uniformly

15. POSITIONAL BIAS
    - Node identities and initial features heavily influence embeddings
    - Graph structure information diluted by feature information
    - Positional encodings partially address (emerging approach)

16. HETEROGENEOUS GRAPH COMPLEXITY
    - Multi-relational graphs require separate learned weights per relation
    - Increases parameters and complexity
    - Specialized architectures (HAN, RGCN) needed; not addressed by base GNNs
