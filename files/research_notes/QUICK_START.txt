================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDING: THE GENERALIZATION PROBLEM
================================================================================

All deep learning models for LOB prediction show SEVERE out-of-sample
degradation:

    Training: 2021 data → Testing: 2021 data = F1 65-70%
    Training: 2021 data → Testing: 2022 data = F1 45-50%

    DEGRADATION: 15-25 percentage point drop

This is THE most important empirical finding in 2020-2025 literature.
Models are NOT deployment-ready without addressing this issue.

================================================================================
STATE OF THE ART (2024-2025)
================================================================================

PRICE PREDICTION
  Model: TLOB (Transformer with dual attention) - 2025
  In-Sample: F1 72-75% on FI-2010
  Out-of-Sample: F1 55-58%
  Issue: Severe generalization failure

VOLATILITY FORECASTING
  Model: DeepVol or GARCH-Informed Neural Networks
  Metric: MAPE 12-18% (5-minute horizon)
  Finding: Hybrid models beat pure deep learning

MARKET IMPACT
  HFT Liquidity Provision: 0.5-1.0 bps spread improvement
  HFT Temporary Impact: 1-3 bps
  Inventory Effects: 5-15% spread widening

ORDER FLOW
  Model: Order-Dependent Hawkes or Neural Hawkes
  Improvement: 8-12% log-likelihood vs. Poisson
  Scalability: Billions of data points (2010-2023)

MARKET MAKING
  Strategy: Deep RL with Hawkes information
  Performance: Sharpe 1.10-1.45 (vs. 0.4-0.5 baseline)
  Improvement: 50-75% over static spreads
  Problem: Not tested on real markets yet

================================================================================
RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES (UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS)
================================================================================

1. GENERALIZATION (CRITICAL)
   Problem: All models degrade 15-25 pts on out-of-sample data
   Opportunity: Domain adaptation, transfer learning for LOB data
   Impact: HIGH (enables real-world deployment)

2. REAL-WORLD APPLICABILITY
   Problem: High prediction ≠ profitable signals
   Opportunity: End-to-end evaluation with transaction costs
   Impact: HIGH (connects research to practice)

3. THEORY
   Problem: Why are LOB patterns predictive?
   Opportunity: Formal models integrating efficiency, frictions
   Impact: MEDIUM (fundamental understanding)

4. SIM-TO-REAL TRANSFER
   Problem: RL strategies not tested on real markets
   Opportunity: Sim-to-real frameworks, pilot testing
   Impact: HIGH (risk management, deployment)

5. MULTIVARIATE/SYSTEMIC
   Problem: Single-asset focus; cross-asset interactions unclear
   Opportunity: Portfolio execution, systemic risk
   Impact: MEDIUM (broader applications)

6. COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY
   Problem: DL models (100-250 ms) exceed HFT latency (10-50 ms)
   Opportunity: Model compression, online learning, FPGAs
   Impact: HIGH (real-time feasibility)

7. DATA QUALITY
   Problem: Survivor bias, selection bias (liquid stocks only)
   Opportunity: Diverse datasets, international markets
   Impact: MEDIUM (generalization, applicability)

CRITICAL LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
================================================================================

1. GENERALIZATION FAILURE (CRITICAL)
   All deep learning models show 15-25 pt F1 degradation on new data.
   Models not ready for real deployment without retraining strategies.

2. SIM-TO-REAL GAP
   RL market making results (Sharpe 1.15-1.45) from simulations only.
   Real-market performance NOT YET validated.

3. DATASET BIASES
   FI-2010: 2010 data, Nordic exchange, 5 stocks (outdated)
   LOB-2021/2022: US only, large-cap bias, survivors
   No comprehensive multi-exchange, multi-country benchmarks

4. LATENCY CONSTRAINTS
   Deep learning models require 100-250 ms inference time
   HFT latency budget: 10-50 ms on CPUs
   GPU required for real-time deployment (increases complexity)

5. MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE
   High-frequency data contains substantial noise
   Denoising methods for multivariate LOB still underdeveloped
   Implications for volatility and covariance estimation unclear
