## KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE

**Black-Scholes Model Limitations:**
- Constant volatility unrealistic
- Underprices put options by 10-20%
- Ignores jump discontinuities
- Normal distribution assumption violated

**Current Best Practice (2024):**
- European options: Heston stochastic volatility
- American options: Binomial trees or finite difference
- Interest rates: Hull-White model
- Volatility products: Rough volatility models

**Major Research Gaps:**
1. Volatility calibration instability
2. Multi-factor option pricing models
3. Out-of-sample validation frameworks
4. Regime-switching with stochastic volatility
5. Transaction costs integration
