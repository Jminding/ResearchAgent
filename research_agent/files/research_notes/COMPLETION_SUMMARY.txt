2. Temporal Dependence in Forecast Tests
   - DM test behavior under strong autocorrelation
   - Improved critical value calculations needed

3. Computational Scalability
   - MCS computationally expensive for 100+ models
   - Need for scalable algorithms

4. Transaction Cost Modeling
   - Limited guidance on realistic cost assumptions
   - Impact on Sharpe ratios (15-20% reduction observed)

5. Regime-Switching Detection
   - Few adaptive procedures for time-varying parameters
   - Limited guidance on structural break accommodation

6. Alternative Distribution Modeling
   - Limited benchmarking of Student-t, skewed-t, mixture models

KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
====================

1. Classical Statistical Methods (1970s-2000s)
   - Ljung-Box, ARCH tests form foundation
   - Still widely adopted in practice
   - Computationally simple and transparent

2. Regulatory Frameworks
   - Basel Committee VaR backtesting widely adopted
   - Traffic light approach ad hoc but practical
   - Kupiec POF test provides statistical foundation

3. Forecast Comparison (1990s-2010s)
   - Diebold-Mariano test standard for pairwise comparison
   - Model Confidence Sets handle multiple models
   - Allow for serially correlated, non-normal errors

4. Deep Learning Challenges (2020-2025)
   - Models achieve 90-95% in-sample accuracy
   - Significant out-of-sample degradation reported
   - Questions about real-world applicability remain

5. Best Practices (2024-2025)
   - Walk-forward validation is gold standard
   - Multi-test diagnostics (Ljung-Box + ARCH LM + JB)
   - Out-of-sample evaluation on 20-30% holdout
   - Transaction cost inclusion essential for realistic results

CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART
=========================

Classical Models (ARIMA, GARCH):
- Specification via AIC/BIC
- Ljung-Box + ARCH LM + Jarque-Bera diagnostics
- Out-of-sample validation
- VaR backtesting for risk models

Deep Learning (LSTM, Transformers):
- Time-series aware data splitting
- 10-fold cross-validation
- Walk-forward validation across time windows
- Critical: Assess out-of-sample degradation rigorously

Multi-Model Comparison:
- 2 models: Diebold-Mariano test
- 3+ models: Model Confidence Set (Hansen 2011)
- Multi-horizon: Extended MCS framework

All major use cases documented:
1. GARCH model validation (Python code with expected output)
