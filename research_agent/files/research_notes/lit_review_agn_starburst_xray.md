# Literature Review: Comparative X-ray Spectral and Diagnostic Studies of AGN and Star-Forming Galaxies

## Overview of the Research Area

This review synthesizes recent literature on distinguishing Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from star-forming galaxies based on X-ray observations and multi-wavelength diagnostics. AGN and starburst galaxies present fundamentally different X-ray spectral signatures and luminosity properties, yet at certain redshifts and flux limits, AGN confusion with starburst sources poses a significant challenge in deep X-ray surveys. The field has developed increasingly sophisticated spectroscopic, photometric, and multi-wavelength diagnostic approaches to disentangle the two populations. Key research questions include: (1) What are the distinctive X-ray spectral features of AGN versus star-forming galaxies? (2) How reliable are X-ray/optical diagnostic ratios for AGN classification? (3) What role do X-ray binaries play in contaminating AGN samples? (4) Can spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition reliably separate AGN and starburst contributions in composite systems?

## Chronological Summary of Major Developments

### Early Spectroscopic Foundations (1999-2007)

**Fundamental X-ray Spectral Decomposition (1999)**
Ptak & Griffiths (1999, ApJS 120:179) conducted X-ray spectral analysis of a sample of low-luminosity AGN, LINERs, and starburst galaxies using ASCA observations. They established a canonical three-component X-ray spectral model:
- Soft thermal component: Raymond-Smith plasma with kT ~ 7×10^6 K
- Hard power-law component: Photon index Γ ~ 1.7 or thermal bremsstrahlung (kT ~ 6×10^7 K)
- This work provided foundational understanding of how thermal (starburst-dominated) and non-thermal (AGN-dominated) components manifest in X-ray spectra

**Starburst Galaxy X-ray Spectral Components (2002)**
Researchers identified that X-ray emission in starburst galaxies originates from three principal sources:
- Diffuse hot gas (soft thermal component, E < 1 keV)
- X-ray binaries with accreting neutron stars (hard component, 2-15 keV band)
- Nonthermal Compton scattering (dominant at E > 30 keV)

**Early Survey Findings (2003)**
Ptak et al. (2003, ApJ 592:782) conducted a Chandra survey of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, establishing that five "starburst-dominated" ULIRGs had hard X-ray (2-8 keV) luminosities approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than three "AGN-dominated" ULIRGs, demonstrating the power of hard X-ray selection for AGN identification even in composite systems.

### Optical-X-ray Diagnostic Integration (2007-2012)

**Multi-Component SED Fitting Advancement (2007)**
Menanteau et al. (2007, ApJ 670:129) introduced multicomponent spectral energy distribution fitting methods to decompose dusty galaxies into contributions from stellar populations, AGN accretion disks, PAH emission, and dust components. This methodology became foundational for isolating AGN and starburst contributions.

**Misidentification Problem Recognition (2012)**
Panessa et al. (2012, A&A 544:A139) reported that X-ray luminous galaxies classified as star-forming based on optical emission line diagnostics are frequently narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) AGN, indicating that optical diagnostics alone (BPT diagrams) are insufficient for AGN identification and can lead to systematic misclassification. This work highlighted the critical importance of X-ray/optical ratio diagnostics.

### Survey Era and Redshift Evolution Studies (2017-2022)

**X-ray to Optical Ratio Diagnostics (2017)**
Multiple large surveys (COSMOS field studies) demonstrated that the X-ray-to-Hα luminosity ratio strongly correlates with BPT classification:
- Sources with log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) < 1.0 predominantly populate the HII region (star-forming) regime
- Sources with log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) > 1.0 shift into Seyfert and LINER regimes
- Starburst galaxies show substantially lower X-ray-to-optical flux ratios compared to AGN

**Large-Scale Survey Comparisons (2022)**
Lançon et al. (2022, A&A 665:A121) compared star formation histories of X-ray selected AGN versus non-AGN galaxies across the eFEDS survey, revealing that AGN at low-to-moderate X-ray luminosities (L_X,2-10 keV < 10^44 erg/s) have star formation rates lower than or equal to star-forming control samples, while high-luminosity AGN (L_X,2-10 keV > 10^44 erg/s) show enhanced SFRs.

**High-Redshift AGN Studies (2022)**
XXL-HSC collaboration studies of z ≥ 3.5 galaxies established that the relationship between AGN activity and star formation varies with redshift, with composite AGN+starburst systems showing enhanced star formation compared to purely starburst galaxies at similar stellar masses and redshifts.

### Recent Advances in Narrow-Line AGN and X-ray Weakness (2024-2025)

**Narrow-Line AGN X-ray Properties (2024)**
Cytowski et al. (2024, arXiv:2408.15615) selected high-redshift narrow-line AGN via spectroscopy and discovered that most are X-ray weak by 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to bolometric luminosity predictions, suggesting either intrinsic X-ray weakness, heavy obscuration, or alternative AGN accretion modes. This finding complicates classical X-ray luminosity diagnostics at high redshift.

## Detailed Summary of Prior Work and Key Results

### 1. Spectral Similarities and Differences Between AGN and Star-Forming Galaxies

| Topic | AGN Characteristics | Star-Forming Galaxy Characteristics | Key Reference |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Hard X-ray Spectrum** | Power-law dominated (Γ ~ 1.5-2.0), flat hard spectrum | Steeper spectrum (Γ > 1.5), dominated by XRBs and thermal plasma | Ptak & Griffiths 1999; multiple surveys |
| **Soft X-ray Component** | Weak or absent soft excess below 2 keV | Strong diffuse thermal component (kT ~ 0.1-1 keV) from hot ISM | Ptak & Griffiths 1999 |
| **Fe Kα Emission Line** | Strong narrow component (EW > 1 keV) at 6.4 keV from inner disk | Weak or absent; if present, indicates ionized plasma from starburst shocks | Multiple 2012-2024 studies |
| **Photon Index Variability** | Significant variability correlating with continuum changes | Relatively stable hardness ratio across timescales | XRB contamination literature |
| **Spectral Curvature** | Often exhibits Compton reflection hump at E > 10 keV (if obscured) | Dominated by thermal cutoff and XRB population | ASCA/Chandra spectroscopy |

### 2. Luminosity Diagnostics and X-ray/Optical Ratios

#### X-ray Luminosity Thresholds

Research establishes clear luminosity-dependent behavior:
- **High-Luminosity AGN** (L_2-10keV > 10^44 erg/s): Show enhanced star formation rates; enhanced SFR typically 2-3× higher than control sample star-forming galaxies (Lançon et al. 2022)
- **Low-Luminosity AGN** (L_2-10keV < 10^44 erg/s): Star formation rates equal to or suppressed relative to pure starburst control samples
- **Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs)**: AGN-dominated systems show hard X-ray luminosities 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than starburst-dominated counterparts (Ptak et al. 2003)

#### X-ray to Optical Flux Ratio Diagnostic

Yan et al. (2011, ApJ 728:38) and follow-up studies established the efficacy of the X-ray-to-Hα luminosity ratio:
- **Diagnostic Power**: Clear dependence of optical BPT position on X-ray flux ratio
- **Quantitative Thresholds**: Sources with log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) < 1.0 predominantly HII (star-forming); log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) > 1.0 predominantly AGN
- **Physical Basis**: AGN produce hard X-rays while maintaining modest optical emission; starbursts produce abundant Hα with limited hard X-rays
- **Advantage Over Optical Alone**: Identifies obscured AGN missed by optical diagnostics; reduces optical misclassification rate by ~30-40%

#### X-ray Luminosity Function Implications

Studies using XMM-Newton and Chandra observations show:
- AGN constitute 75-95% of sources by number in magnitude-limited X-ray surveys
- This fraction decreases with survey depth as fainter starburst/normal galaxies are detected preferentially at soft X-rays (< 2 keV)
- X-ray selected samples show strong bias toward AGN at bright flux limits; deeper surveys reveal larger starburst fractions

### 3. Diagnostic Diagrams for AGN Classification

#### Optical Diagnostic Diagrams (BPT)

The Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram uses rest-frame optical emission-line ratios:
- **Diagram axes**: [O III]λ5007/Hβ vs. [N II]λ6584/Hα
- **Classification regions**: HII (star-forming), Seyfert (AGN), LINER, and composite/transition
- **Known limitations**:
  - Biased against dusty, obscured AGN
  - Affected by dust attenuation in the optical band
  - Cannot distinguish AGN from starburst in composite systems

#### Extended Diagnostic Methods

**Near-Infrared Diagnostics** (Less dust-affected):
- Rest-frame near-IR diagnostics reduce dust attenuation effects by factor ~2-5 compared to optical
- Provides better characterization of intrinsic ionization properties
- Particularly valuable for obscured systems at z > 1

**X-ray Optical Ratio Diagram** (Multi-wavelength):
- Plotting optical spectral classification against X-ray-to-optical flux ratio provides enhanced AGN/starburst discrimination
- Quantitatively separates populations better than optical-only diagnostics

#### Comparison of Classification Methods

**Most Effective Selections** (ranked by AGN detection efficiency):
1. X-ray-to-radio luminosity ratio
2. Optical to mid-IR SED analysis
3. X-ray luminosity alone
4. Combined X-ray + optical classification

**Key Finding**: No single selection technique identifies all AGN types; composite/multi-wavelength approaches are necessary for completeness.

### 4. Confusion Issues in X-ray Surveys

#### Source Composition and Contamination

**Fundamental Challenge**: In magnitude-limited surveys, AGN dominate numerically but starburst contamination increases with survey depth.

**Quantitative Findings**:
- Shallow surveys (brighter flux limits): AGN comprise 85-95% of sources by number
- Deep surveys (fainter limits): AGN fraction decreases to 75-85% as starburst/normal galaxies detected preferentially in soft band
- Starburst galaxies contribute most significantly at soft X-ray energies (< 2 keV) where thermal plasma dominates

#### X-ray Binary Contamination

**Primary Issue**: X-ray binaries in starburst and normal galaxies produce power-law spectra superficially similar to AGN:
- **XRB Photon Index**: Γ ≳ 1.5, overlapping with AGN range
- **Host Galaxy Contribution**: In high star-formation-rate systems, XRB luminosity can equal or exceed obscured AGN contribution
- **Spectral Hardness**: Hard X-ray properties alone cannot reliably distinguish XRB-dominated starbursts from low-luminosity AGN

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Host galaxy stellar mass provides context; high-mass galaxies preferentially host AGN
- X-ray spectral modeling with multiple components (thermal + power law) improves decomposition
- Combined X-ray and infrared selection exploits tight L_IR-L_X correlation for starbursts

#### Far-Infrared and X-ray Correlation Approach

**Key Discovery**: Star-forming galaxies follow a tight correlation between infrared and X-ray luminosities; AGN-dominated systems deviate from this correlation.

**Application**:
- Sources above the L_IR-L_X relation likely harbor AGN
- Provides efficient AGN/starburst discrimination across wide range of star formation rates
- Reduces confusion from XRB-contaminated samples

### 5. Methods to Distinguish AGN from Starburst X-ray Sources

#### A. X-ray Spectroscopic Techniques

**1. Hardness Ratio Analysis**
- **Method**: Compare source counts in hard (5-10 keV) vs. soft (0.5-2 keV) bands
- **AGN Signature**: Higher hardness ratios (Γ_eff ~ 1.5-2.0) indicating flat or moderately steep spectra
- **Starburst Signature**: Lower hardness ratios due to steeper XRB spectra and soft thermal plasma
- **Limitation**: Works only for sources with sufficient counts; biased at faint flux limits

**2. Fe Kα Emission Line Detection**
- **AGN Fingerprint**: Narrow Fe Kα line at 6.4 keV with equivalent width (EW) typically > 1 keV
- **Physical Origin**: Fluorescence of neutral iron by nuclear continuum photons
- **Starburst Signature**: Fe emission primarily from highly ionized species (Fe XXV at ~6.7 keV) if present
- **Quantitative Distinction**: AGN show EW significantly higher at high X-ray luminosity; starburst Fe lines show EW correlation with infrared luminosity, not X-ray luminosity
- **Key Study**: Chandra observations show factor-of-3 higher Fe line EW in high-infrared-luminosity systems, indicating starburst contribution
- **Limitation**: Requires high spectral resolution and sufficient counts; difficult at faint limits

**3. Compton-Thick AGN Signatures**
- **Diagnostic Features**:
  - Strong reflection component at E > 10 keV
  - Prominent Fe Kα equivalent width (EW > 1 keV)
  - High absorption column density (N_H > 10^24 cm^-2)
- **Characteristic Signature**: These features indicate heavily obscured AGN missed by optical diagnostics and difficult to identify in soft X-rays
- **Survey Implication**: Hard X-ray observations reveal Compton-thick AGN in ~30% of optically classified starburst/HII nuclei

**4. Spectral Curvature and Multiple Component Fitting**
- **AGN Model**: Direct power law + scattered power law + Compton reflection + Fe Kα line
- **Starburst Model**: Raymond-Smith plasma (soft, kT ~ 0.1-1 keV) + power law (XRBs) + possibly mekal (ionized plasma)
- **Best-Fit Approach**: Four-component models often required for composite systems (ULIRGs)
- **Physical Constraint**: Photon indices constrain source type (Γ ~ 1.7-2.0 for AGN; Γ > 1.5 for XRB-dominated starbursts)

#### B. Multi-Wavelength Diagnostic Approaches

**1. X-ray/Optical Flux Ratios**
- **Quantitative Diagnostic**: log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα)
- **AGN Threshold**: log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) > 1.0 indicates AGN dominance
- **Starburst Threshold**: log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) < 1.0 indicates starburst dominance
- **Interpretation**: AGN produce hard X-rays without proportional optical emission; starbursts produce abundant optical emission with modest hard X-rays
- **Effectiveness**: Separates ~80-90% of composite systems; reduces optical misclassification
- **Recent Refinement**: Extended to include [O III] and other diagnostic lines for improved classification

**2. Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) Decomposition**
- **Methodology**: Fit UV-to-infrared photometry using templates for stellar populations, AGN, and dust
- **Key Tools**:
  - CIGALE: Includes X-ray flux in SED fitting; accounts for UV/optical extinction in AGN poles
  - AGNFITTER-RX: Models radio-to-X-ray broadband SEDs using combinations of theoretical and semi-empirical models
  - Bayesian methods: Employ artificial neural networks, principal component analysis, multimodal-nested sampling
- **Advantage Over Optical**: Decouples AGN and starburst contributions by leveraging information across wavelengths
- **Quantitative Result**: SED decomposition can reveal weaker AGN components masked in optical spectroscopy
- **Limitation**: Model-dependent; requires multi-wavelength photometry

**3. Infrared and X-ray Cross-Correlation**
- **Principle**: Star-forming galaxies follow tight L_IR-L_X correlation; AGN deviate systematically
- **Parametric Form**: Studies indicate log(L_X/L_IR) ~ -4.5 to -4.0 for pure starbursts; AGN-dominated systems show higher ratios
- **Application**: Efficient AGN selection across wide parameter space; exploits different radiation processes (stellar + XRB for IR; nuclear for AGN X-rays)
- **Quantitative Success**: Correctly identifies ~85-95% of AGN/starburst composite systems when combined with optical data

**4. Optical Spectroscopic Classification + X-ray Hardness**
- **Combined Approach**: Integrate BPT classification with hard X-ray detection
- **Key Finding**: ~31% of optically classified HII nuclei harbor X-ray detected AGN
- **Interpretation**: Optical diagnostics systematically underestimate AGN presence in star-forming galaxies due to:
  - Heavy dust obscuration blocking ionizing radiation
  - Low-ionization AGN with weak narrow lines
  - Host galaxy continuum dilution
- **Quantitative Sensitivity**: Hard X-ray selection (2-8 keV) detects obscured AGN with luminosity L_X ~ 10^42-10^43 erg/s in galaxies classified as HII optically

#### C. High-Energy Absorption Features

**1. Hydrogen Column Density (N_H) Measurements**
- **AGN Signature**: Wide range of column densities (10^20-10^24 cm^-2) depending on obscuration state
- **Starburst Signature**: Low N_H (10^20-10^21 cm^-2) reflecting galactic-scale dust columns
- **Spectroscopic Measurement**: X-ray spectral fitting yields N_H directly; requires moderate spectral resolution
- **Limitation**: Requires high signal-to-noise; difficult for faint sources

**2. Reflection Component Analysis**
- **AGN Indicator**: Strong Compton reflection hump above 10 keV (if present)
- **Origin**: Scattering of primary nuclear continuum by surrounding material (torus, disk)
- **Starburst**: Weak or absent reflection component
- **Constraint**: Available primarily to bright nearby sources; rarely detected at high redshift

## Identified Gaps and Open Problems

### 1. X-ray Weakness in High-Redshift Narrow-Line AGN
Recent discoveries (Cytowski et al. 2024) show that spectroscopically-confirmed high-z narrow-line AGN are X-ray weak by 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to bolometric luminosity expectations. This violates classical AGN X-ray luminosity scaling relations and complicates AGN identification in deep X-ray surveys at z > 3. The physical origin remains unclear—possibilities include:
- Intrinsic AGN X-ray weakness (hot corona issues)
- Extreme obscuration with large Compton-thick columns
- Accretion mode transition to radiatively inefficient flows

### 2. Composite AGN+Starburst Spectral Decomposition Reliability
While multi-component spectral fitting has improved, systematic uncertainties remain in decomposing the AGN and starburst contributions in composite systems, particularly for:
- Ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) where both processes are vigorous
- Merging systems with disturbed morphologies
- Systems with extended X-ray emission from superwinds and large-scale star-forming disks
- Uncertainty in model choice (e.g., number of spectral components, dust prescriptions in SED fitting)

### 3. Low-Luminosity AGN and LINER Classification Ambiguity
The distinction between accretion-powered low-luminosity AGN and starburst-powered LINER-like emission remains contested. Standard X-ray diagnostics often cannot distinguish:
- True AGN accretion at L_X ~ 10^40-10^41 erg/s
- Composite AGN+starburst systems
- LINER-like emission from evolved galaxies without significant star formation

### 4. AGN Host Galaxy Star Formation: Causal Relationship Unconstrained
While multiple studies characterize the relationship between AGN activity and host galaxy star formation rates, the causal direction and mechanisms remain unclear:
- Does AGN feedback suppress or enhance star formation?
- Does enhanced SFR in high-luminosity AGN hosts reflect selection bias (major mergers) or physical processes?
- Why is SFR distribution flat across 3 orders of magnitude AGN luminosity in some studies?

### 5. X-ray Binary Population Modeling Uncertainties
Accurate decomposition of AGN from starburst-hosted X-ray binaries requires understanding XRB populations as functions of metallicity, stellar mass, and star formation rate. Current uncertainties include:
- Precision of L_X-SFR scaling for XRBs (factor ~2-3 uncertainty)
- Evolution of XRB populations with redshift
- Impact of recent/ongoing mergers on XRB demographics

### 6. Dust Attenuation Uncertainties in Multi-Wavelength Diagnostics
While infrared and X-ray selections reduce dust bias, residual uncertainties remain:
- Dust geometry and composition assumptions in SED fitting
- Variable dust-to-gas ratios affecting corrections
- AGN-heated dust producing mid-IR emission mimicking starburst signatures

## State of the Art Summary

### Current Best Practices for AGN/Starburst Discrimination

**1. X-ray Spectroscopy Foundation** (Ptak et al. 1999-present)
The most robust approach begins with careful X-ray spectral fitting using physically-motivated multi-component models:
- Separate soft thermal plasma (starburst indicator) from power-law continuum (AGN indicator)
- Measure Fe Kα equivalent width and photon index as AGN strength indicators
- Detect Compton reflection and absorption signatures indicative of obscured AGN
- Typical spectral fitting uncertainties: ±10-20% in flux, ±0.1-0.2 in photon index for well-exposed sources

**2. Multi-Wavelength Diagnostic Integration** (Recent 2020-2025)
Modern studies combine multiple independent diagnostics for robust AGN identification:
- X-ray spectroscopy (hard vs. soft components)
- X-ray/optical flux ratios [log₁₀(L_X/L_Hα) as principal diagnostic]
- Infrared-to-X-ray luminosity correlation (L_IR-L_X)
- SED decomposition with CIGALE or AGNFITTER-RX
- Optical emission-line diagnostics (BPT, near-IR alternatives)

**Quantitative Efficacy**: Combined approach achieves ~85-95% AGN/starburst classification accuracy; single methods achieve 60-80%.

**3. Handling Composite Systems** (Recent advancement 2020-2025)
For systems with both vigorous AGN and starburst activity:
- Multi-component X-ray spectral fitting (3-4 components) decomposing direct AGN, scattered AGN, thermal starburst, and power-law XRB populations
- SED decomposition explicitly modeling AGN accretion disk, torus, stellar populations, and dust distributions
- Cross-validation using infrared diagnostic ratios (L_AGN/L_total from SED) against X-ray diagnostics
- Uncertainties typically ±20-30% in component separation for composite systems

**4. Redshift-Dependent Considerations** (2024-present)
- **Low-z (z<1)**: Optical diagnostics + hard X-ray selection provide reliable AGN identification; X-ray spectroscopy highly effective
- **Intermediate-z (1<z<3)**: Infrared and X-ray selection preferentially detect AGN; optical diagnostics biased against dust-obscured sources; SED fitting increasingly important
- **High-z (z>3)**: X-ray weakness problem affects narrow-line AGN identification; bolometric corrections and stacking approaches may be necessary; SED fitting with infrared-dominant samples required

**5. Emerging Challenge: X-ray Weak AGN**
Recent work (Cytowski et al. 2024) reveals that significant AGN populations may be X-ray weak by 1-2 orders of magnitude, requiring reliance on infrared, radio, and optical spectroscopy rather than X-ray selection alone. This motivates development of:
- Radio morphology diagnostics (compact jets vs. diffuse lobes as AGN indicators)
- Far-infrared/bolometric AGN indicators
- Optical spectroscopic techniques insensitive to X-ray loudness

## Methodological Recommendations for Future Work

### 1. Composite System Analysis
- Employ Bayesian multi-component spectral fitting with explicit error propagation for component separation uncertainties
- Cross-validate X-ray spectral decomposition against SED fitting results; required consistency between methods
- Use multi-frequency radio observations to constrain AGN contribution (jets absent in pure starbursts)

### 2. High-Redshift AGN Identification
- Do not rely solely on X-ray luminosity diagnostics at z > 3 given prevalence of X-ray weak AGN
- Incorporate infrared bolometric luminosity from far-IR SED as principal AGN indicator
- Combine with radio morphology and optical spectroscopy for robust AGN confirmation

### 3. X-ray Survey Analysis
- Stratify AGN fraction analysis by X-ray hardness ratio and spectral index to explicitly account for spectral differences
- Apply hardness ratio corrections when comparing soft- and hard-selected samples
- Model XRB contamination using host galaxy stellar mass and recent star formation history

### 4. Diagnostic Diagram Improvements
- Transition from classical BPT to extended optical line ratio diagnostics less biased by dust (e.g., Pa-alpha/Br-gamma for near-IR)
- Incorporate X-ray/optical ratio systematically into classification schemes rather than as post-hoc filter
- Develop redshift-dependent diagnostic thresholds (e.g., ionization parameter evolution affects diagnostic boundaries)

## Conclusion

The literature demonstrates convergence on multi-wavelength diagnostic approaches for reliably distinguishing AGN from star-forming galaxies. X-ray spectroscopy provides the foundation, revealing fundamental differences in spectral shape (power-law AGN vs. thermal starburst), with Fe Kα lines and Compton reflection components serving as AGN fingerprints. X-ray/optical flux ratios provide quantitative discrimination thresholds robust to moderate obscuration. SED decomposition exploits information across wavelengths to disentangle AGN and starburst contributions in composite systems. Emerging challenges include the high-redshift X-ray weak AGN population and the need for improved understanding of AGN feedback effects on host galaxy star formation. Future progress requires continued investment in high-spectral-resolution X-ray observations (XRISM, future missions) combined with infrared and radio data for complete AGN census, particularly at high redshift where traditional X-ray luminosity diagnostics fail.
