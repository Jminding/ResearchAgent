## Galaxy Mergers and AGN Triggering Mechanisms

### Merger-Triggered AGN Statistics (2024-2025)

**Euclid Dataset Analysis (2025)**
- **Sample Size**: 1 million galaxies analyzed for merger-AGN connection
- **AGN Excess in Mergers**: Merging galaxies show 2-6× more AGN than non-merging control samples
- **High-Luminosity AGN**: At bolometric luminosity >10^45 erg/s, AGN mostly reside in mergers
- **Merger Contamination**: Mergers strongly linked to most powerful, dust-obscured AGN with rapid SMBH growth

**AGN Activity Timing During Mergers**
- **Peak AGN Excess Timing**: Occurs immediately after coalescence (0 < T_PM < 0.16 Gyr post-merger)
- **AGN Enhancement Duration**: Long-lived influence lasting 1-2 Gyr post-coalescence
- **Luminosity-Dependent Enhancement**: AGN in post-mergers are generally more luminous than secularly-triggered AGN

## Secular Processes and Instabilities

### Galactic Bars and AGN Triggering

**Resonance Effects on Gas Dynamics**
- **Inner Lindblad Resonances**: Gas confined to rings near resonances, creating obstacles to AGN feeding at hundreds of parsec scales
- **Secular Evolution Role**: Angular momentum transfer mediated by non-axisymmetric instabilities is motor of secular galaxy evolution
- **Bar Formation**: Genesis influenced by gravitational instabilities, evolution regulated by angular momentum transfer

## Environmental Factors and AGN Activity

### Galaxy Cluster Environment Effects (2024)

**Environmental Dependence (Magneticum Simulations)**

- **Massive Galaxies**: Star-formation level increases in inner regions, peaks at 0.5-1 R500 with rapid decline in centre
  - AGN activity declines in inner regions, rapidly rises below R500 toward centre
- **Cluster Outskirts**: Excess AGN activity in massive galaxies at ~3 R500

**Physical Mechanisms in Clusters**
- **Harassment Effects**: Gravitational interactions during frequent flybys transform disc galaxies to ellipticals
- **Gas Transport**: Harassment can transport gas to galaxy centers, triggering starbursts and AGN
- **BCG Processing Mechanisms** (2025): Flows of cooling gas, ram pressure/sloshing of ICM, and galactic tides

## AGN Feedback and Outflows (2024-2025)

### Feedback Mechanisms and Observational Evidence

**Energy Coupling Mechanisms**
- **Multiple Pathways**: Radiation pressure on dust, accretion disc winds, radio jets, and cosmic rays all contribute
- **Shocked ISM**: Detected radio emission traces range of processes including shocked ISM from AGN outflows

**Outflow Kinematics and Acceleration**
- **Radial Velocity Trends**: Outflows initially constant/slightly decreasing, then rapid acceleration starting ~1 kpc from nucleus
- **Multi-Phase Outflows**: Growing observations in warm molecular gas via JWST at low and high redshift

**Multi-Phase Observations**
- **UV, Optical, Sub-mm, Radio Data**: Combined archival data allows assessment of different gas phase contributions
- **Outflow Properties**: Enable measurement of relative contributions to outflow rates, kinetic energy, and coupling efficiencies

### AGN Feedback on Galaxy Evolution
- **Star Formation Impact**: AGN jets/winds heat cold gas, temporarily stopping star formation (gas eventually cools, SF resumes)
