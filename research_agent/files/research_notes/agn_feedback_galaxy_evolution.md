## AGN Feedback Modes: Quasar-Mode vs. Kinetic-Mode

### Quasar-Mode (Radiative-Mode) Feedback

**Outflow Characteristics:**
- **Ubiquity**: 100% of Type 1 quasar sample hosts warm ionized and/or cool neutral outflows
- **Outflow velocities**: Spatially averaged 200-1,300 km/s; peak velocities 500-2,600 km/s
- **Spatial extent**: Minor-axis outflows reaching 3-12 kiloparsecs (kpc)
- **Mass outflow rates**: Highly variable, ranging 1 to >1,000 M⊙/yr
- **Momentum boost values**: 0.01-20
- **Correlation with black hole mass**: Both mass outflow rate and kinetic energy correlate with BH mass

**Accretion Properties:**
- Operates at high bolometric luminosities with accretion rates close to Eddington
- Wide-angle outflow geometry
- Black hole accretion rate density decline: Factor of ≤10 since z ≈ 2

### Kinetic-Mode (Radio-Mode) Feedback

**Jet Properties:**
- **Collimated jets** of relativistic particles accelerated by intense magnetic fields in accretion disk
- **Accretion rate density**: Remains roughly constant since z ≈ 2 (unlike quasar-mode which declines)
- **Low accretion rates** characteristic of radio-mode operation
- **Energy injection mechanism**: Powerful jets that heat circumgalactic and halo gas

**Space Density Evolution:**
- Jet-mode radio-AGN show decreasing space density with redshift at low radio luminosities
- Increasing space density at higher radio luminosities
- Radiative-mode radio-AGN show ~order of magnitude increase in space density to z ≈ 1

## Galactic Winds and Outflows: Mechanisms and Impact

### Outflow Velocities and Scales

**AGN-Driven Outflow Velocities:**
- **Giant elliptical/cluster environments**: 4,000-7,000 km/s at ~1 kpc
- **Star-forming galaxies**: 1,000-2,000 km/s (typical)
- **High-redshift galaxies**: 80-500 km/s (z ≈ 2-3)
- **Median outflow velocity in Type 1 quasars**: 200-1,300 km/s spatially averaged

### Mass Loading Factors

**Outflow Mass Rate to Star Formation Rate Ratio (η):**
- **Elliptical galaxies (M87, Perseus)**: Outflow-to-accretion mass-loading factor = 200-500
- **High-redshift AGN (z ≈ 2)**: η ∼ 0.1–2.0
- **High-redshift galaxies generally**: η = 0.1–1.0
- **AGN luminosity effect**: AGN can boost outflow rate by ~10x compared to stellar feedback

### Star Formation Suppression Requirements

**Momentum Flux Thresholds:**
- **Required for star formation suppression**: τ_w ≳ 3 (momentum flux units)
- **Insufficient for global suppression**: τ_w ≲ 3 (still produces modest galaxy-scale outflows but minimal ISM impact)
- **Observed complexity**: Star formation can persist at >15 M⊙/yr even inside massive AGN outflows

**Relationship to AGN Power:**
- Star formation impact is NON-LINEAR and complex even in well-studied systems
- No simple correlation between AGN wind strength and star formation rate
- Galaxies hosting AGN (≈10% of universe) show same star-forming fractions as control samples at all redshifts

## Impact on Star Formation and Galaxy Morphology

### Quenching Mechanisms and Timescales

**Quenching Dependence:**
- **Primary control parameter**: Black hole mass (most predictive at all epochs)
- **Secondary parameter**: Black hole accretion rate has little predictive power
- **Quenching age in radio AGN hosts**: ≈5 Gyr (at larger lookback times than radio jet age ~<1 Gyr)
- **Time delay between star formation quenching and radio-AGN onset**: 1.5-2 Gyr

**AGN Jet Switching Timescales:**
- **Rapid mode switching**: If FRII quasar/AGN is powerful, accretion mode switches to hot mode on timescale of millions of years
- **Slow radio-mode quenching**: Contrasts sharply with rapid quasar-mode effects

### Galaxy Morphology Changes Associated with Quenching

**Morphological Characteristics of Quenched Galaxies:**
- **Optical colors**: Redder than star-forming counterparts
- **Stellar populations**: Older ages
- **Morphology**: More elliptical
- **Kinematics**: More pressure-supported (vs. rotation-dominated)
- **Stellar mass**: Higher masses
- **Cosmic environment**: Reside in denser regions

**Host Galaxy Properties:**
- **Dominant state of radio AGN hosts**: Predominantly quiescent systems
- **Growth rates**: Radio AGN hosts grow faster than mass-matched control galaxies
- **Correlation with jet luminosity**: Quenching level shows NO correlation with jet power (surprising)

### Radio AGN Host Galaxy Statistics

**Recent LoTSS-MaNGA Survey (2025):**
- Sample size: 5,548 galaxies (z < 0.15)
- Key finding: Massive radio AGN hosts are predominantly quiescent
- Growth rate advantage: Radio AGN hosts grow faster than control galaxies

## Large-Scale Structure and Environmental Effects

### Clustering and Dark Matter Host Properties

**AGN Clustering Measurements:**
- **Clustering length**: r₀ = 7.2 ± 0.6 h⁻¹ Mpc
- **Bias parameter**: b = 2.26 ± 0.16
- **Average dark matter host halo mass**: ~1.3 × 10¹³ h⁻¹ M⊙

### Environmental Dependence of AGN Activity

**Local Environmental Density Effects:**
- **LINERs (weakly accreting)**: More abundant in underdensities than clusters
- **Transition objects**: Show enhanced abundance in high-density environments
- **Massive galaxies**: AGN activity declines in cluster centers but rapidly rises toward cluster outskirts (≈3 R₅₀₀)

**Star Formation Environmental Trends:**
- **Low-mass galaxies**: Both AGN activity and star formation decline toward cluster center
- **Massive galaxies**: AGN activity shows complex radial dependence

### Impact on Large-Scale Matter Distribution

**Matter Power Spectrum Effects:**
- **AGN feedback mechanism**: Redistributes gas from halos to circumgalactic medium
- **Small-scale clustering**: Suppression of clustering on small scales
- **Intermediate-large scales**: Boosts at intermediate and large scales
- **Statistical signature**: Quantifiable via two- and three-point clustering statistics

### Cluster Core Cycles and Heating-Cooling Balance

**Feedback-Cooling Equilibrium:**
- **Average radio jet powers**: Near those required to offset radiative losses
- **Heating balance**: Suppresses cooling in giant elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters
- **Feedback coupling**: Heating and cooling are coupled by feedback mechanism
- **Redshift evolution**: No evidence of feedback/cooling equilibrium evolution from z~0 to z~0.6 in SPT clusters

## AGN Jet Power and Feedback Efficiency

### Jet Power Measurements

**Range of Jet Powers Studied:**
- **Low-power jets**: 7.8 × 10⁴³ erg/s
- **Fiducial jets**: 3.9 × 10⁴⁴ erg/s
- **Intermediate jets**: 1-7 × 10⁴⁵ erg/s (kpc-scale simulations)
- **High-power jets**: 1.94 × 10⁴⁵ erg/s
- **Extreme jets**: Up to 10⁴⁶ erg/s (in some AGN systems)

### Cavity Power Method Calculations

**Energy Estimation Technique:**
- **Method**: Calculate total energy in X-ray cavities and divide by inflation timescale
- **Typical timescale**: Buoyancy time (most common)
- **Energy deposition**: Up to ~70% of injected energy deposited in ICM from lower-power jets

### Feedback Efficiency Comparisons

**Mechanical Jets vs. Radiative Feedback:**
- **Mechanical jets**: Drive more powerful outflows, stronger mass and momentum coupling with dense gas
- **Radiative feedback**: Heats and rarefies gas more effectively
- **Energy coupling**: Efficiency depends on jet power, ICM properties, and coupling mechanisms

**Accretion-to-Jet Power Relation:**
- **Scaling relation**: Jet power ∝ Ṁc² × efficiency factor
- **Efficiency dependence**: Depends on accretion physics and magnetic field topology
- **Variable efficiency**: Explains wide range of observed jet powers

3. **Environmental Dependence**: AGN feedback effects vary with local environment (clusters, groups, field)
4. **Multi-Phase Outflows**: AGN drive complex multi-phase (ionized, molecular, neutral) outflows with varied velocities
5. **Heating-Cooling Balance**: Radio-mode feedback maintains heating-cooling equilibrium in massive structures
6. **Simulation Progress**: 2024-2025 simulations include cosmic rays, improved resolution, and better accretion models
7. **Paradoxical Quenching**: Despite powerful feedback, radio AGN effectiveness in quenching remains debated
