# Supermassive Black Holes in AGN and Accretion Disk Physics: 2024-2025 Research Notes

## Key Statistics Summary

### Black Hole-Host Galaxy Relations
- **M-sigma relation slope**: 5.8 (significantly steeper than earlier studies; 2024 analysis of 244 galaxies)
- **Probability of SMBH presence**: 50% at σ = 11 km/s, 90% at σ = 34 km/s, 99% at σ = 126 km/s
- **Early universe overmassive ratio**: Black holes at z > 4 are 2-3 orders of magnitude more massive than local galaxy relations predict (JWST observations)
- **Black hole mass ratio at z=10**: M_BH/M_⋆ = 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than local values (UHZ-1 at z = 10.073 ± 0.002)

### Accretion Rates and Eddington Ratios
- **Eddington ratio decrease with redshift**: ~0.4 at z ≈ 1.5 for M = 10^7.25 M☉, declining to <0.04 for M = 10^10.25 M☉
- **Slim disk transition**: Eddington ratio > 30% triggers transition to geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient 'slim' disk state
- **Low-Eddington AGN example**: NGC 4614 has Eddington ratio ≈ 1% with BH mass ~1.6 × 10^7 M☉
- **Super-Eddington duration**: Growth bursts typically ~1 million years duration
- **Recent simulations**: Allow super-Eddington accretion bursts to explain z > 4 massive black holes and constrain with X-ray upper limits

### Black Hole Spin Measurements
- **M87 spin**: ~80% of theoretical maximum spin (2024-2025 EHT analysis using relativistic Doppler beaming)
- **EHT spin measurement capability**: Future space extension would measure SMBH spin directly and test general relativity
- **X-ray reflection bias**: Most spin measurements from X-ray reflection spectroscopy yield >0.5, suggesting observational selection effects
- **New spin measurement method**: Polarization flip location 10× farther out for slowly spinning BHs vs. rapidly spinning ones (2025 research)
- **Star formation connection**: Star formation rate increases with black hole spin for low star-formation-rate sources

### Magnetic Fields Near Black Holes
- **Field strength near event horizon**: 2.6 tesla (~40,000× Earth's magnetic field) measured by EHT

### Corona Properties (2024)
- **Hot electron temperature**: 0.2-8 × 10^9 K
- **Warm corona electron temperature**: ~0.1-1 keV (X-ray excess emission for wide range of accretion rates and BH masses)
- **Corona structure**: Extends in same direction as accretion disk (not lamp-post geometry), directly imaged by IXPE (2024)

### AGN Variability Timescales
- **Reverberation mapping timescale**: Light travel time between accretion disk and broad line region
- **Damping timescale scaling**: Relation found between timescale and black hole mass across blazars and microquasars (34 blazars + 7 microquasars; 2024)
- **Multi-wavelength variations**: UV/optical more correlated and lagged; observed timescales longer than expected from single-parameter models

### Quasi-Periodic Oscillations

- **Period scale**: <10 gravitational radii coherent motion
- **GRS 1915+105 polarization QPO**: 17 and 33 second periods in radio band
- **Intermediate mass BH QPO**: ~200 days period (>4-sigma significance detected)
- **Timescale range**: Minutes to years across different systems and mechanisms

### Accretion Disk Structure and Temperature
- **Temperature structure**: Increases with distance from black hole
- **High luminosity configuration**: Multicolor blackbody ~1 keV component with weak hard tail
- **Thin disk**: Geometrically thin, optically thick with weak hot corona
- **Radiation flux variation**: Changes with model parameters affecting temperature and luminosity

### Accretion Disk Instabilities
- **Main instability types**: Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) and Convective Overstability (COS)
- **Limit-cycle oscillations**: Driven by ionization instability and radiation pressure instability
- **Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)**: X-ray bursts lasting ~hours to days, repeating on timescales of hours to days
- **Non-axisymmetric perturbations**: May fuel changing-look AGN through spiral shock angular momentum transport

### Broad Line Region (BLR) Kinematics (2024)
- **BLR size consistency**: Relative sizes largely consistent with photoionization model predictions
- **Virial factor determination**: Individual virial factors now derivable for each AGN without reverberation modeling
- **NGC 4151 BLR changes**: Significant geometry and kinematics changes on <1 year timescales
- **BELMAC code**: New tool recovering velocity-delay maps for NGC 5548 with unprecedented detail on geometry, ionization, kinematics

### JWST High-Redshift AGN Observations (2024-2025)
- **UHZ-1 redshift**: z = 10.073 ± 0.002 (earliest known SMBH)
- **CAPERS-LRD-z9 redshift**: z = 9.288 (~0.5 billion years after Big Bang)
- **"The Cliff" redshift**: z = 3.55 (11.9 billion light-year distance)
- **CANUCS-LRD-z8.6**: Most massive host galaxy at such early time, yet central BH even more massive than expected
- **AGN feedback timescale**: Black holes rapidly shut off star formation in massive galaxies through gas removal (first direct confirmation, 2024)

### Black Hole Mass Measurements
- **Reverberation mapping**: Light curve detrending critical to avoid overestimating reverberation timescales
- **RM calibration role**: Calibrates secondary mass-scaling relations for single-epoch virial masses
- **LSST prospects**: Will provide high-cadence photometry for tens of thousands of AGN
- **SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper**: Will monitor 25,000 AGN over multiple epochs

### Relativistic Disk Reflection
- **Iron line center**: ~6.4 keV (fluorescent emission from illuminated disk)
- **Ionized iron lines**: FeXXV and FeXXVI from both internal heating and warm corona reflection
- **Relativistic effects**: Gravitational redshift and Doppler boosting encode black hole spin information
- **Thermal line integration**: Multiple ionized lines integrate into single broad profile near event horizon

### AGN Outflows and Winds
- **Wind velocity**: 0.03-0.3 times speed of light
- **Acceleration pattern**: Initial constant/slight decrease, then rapid acceleration starting ~1 kpc from nucleus
- **Disk wind models**: UV line-driven winds especially prominent in luminous AGNs with UV-peaking spectra
- **Radiative cooling**: Cold clouds survive in hot outflows through efficient cooling at mixing boundaries
- **Wind impact**: Key role in regulating star formation and distributing metals over kiloparsec scales

### AGN Feedback Coupling
- **Unresolved questions**: No theoretical consensus on mechanical coupling mechanisms
- **Candidate mechanisms**: Radiation pressure on dust, accretion disk winds, radio jets, cosmic rays
- **MISTRAL model**: New 2025 model investigating radiatively efficient AGN feedback feasibility at cosmic noon

## Mass and Growth History Studies

### Black Hole Formation and Growth Modes
- **Primary growth mechanism (past 5 Gyr)**: Accretion dominates over mergers for most SMBHs
- **High-z formation challenge**: Early universe SMBH masses require either efficient accretion, massive seeds, or both
- **Two sequences at z > 3**: Dual SMBH mass-bulge plane sequences attributed to different growth triggers (mergers vs. disk instabilities)
- **Observational biases**: Early-universe over-massive black holes can be explained by selection biases in high-z surveys

## Event Horizon Telescope Advances (2024-2025)

### Imaging Resolution and Capabilities
- **Highest resolution frequency**: 345 GHz (0.87mm wavelength) observations achieved
- **Image detail improvement**: 50% more detailed than 1.3mm observations previously possible
- **Spin measurement plans**: Direct spin measurements achievable with extended EHT observations
- **Future targets**: Planned re-imaging of M87* and Sgr A* at both 1.3mm and 0.87mm

## Theoretical Advances and Simulations (2024)

### Super-Eddington Accretion Simulations
- **ΛCDM consistency**: Galaxy formation models with super-Eddington accretion now consistent with JWST massive BH observations
- **Growth spurt duration**: Typical duration ~1 million years
- **Early BH masses**: Simulations now reproduce z > 4 massive black holes previously requiring exotic seeding scenarios
- **Radiation suppression**: X-ray upper limits naturally explained by super-Eddington accretion geometry and radiatively inefficient flows

### Disk Perturbation Physics
- **Changing-look AGN**: Induced by disk-captured tidal disruption events and non-axisymmetric perturbations
- **Spiral shocks**: Density waves steepening into shocks that transport angular momentum
- **Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)**: Marks inner disk edge; particles at r < r_ISCO fall in very short timescale
- **Disk edge physics**: Determines accretion geometry and radiative output

### Compact Object Accretion in AGN
- **December 2025 development**: New method to estimate stellar-mass compact object accretion within AGN disks
- **Multi-body dynamics**: Interactions of stellar-mass objects with SMBH accretion flows

## Key Measurement Techniques and Advances

- **Light curve processing**: Polynomial detrending and convolution filtering improve lag detection
- **Spectroscopic RM**: Direct approach for BH masses outside local universe
- **SDSS-V coverage**: 25,000 AGN monitoring program providing unprecedented sample statistics

### X-ray Polarimetry (2024)
- **IXPE breakthrough**: Direct observation of corona geometry using polarimetry on obscured sources
- **Corona isolation**: Focusing on obscured AGN bypasses disk light overwhelming corona signal
- **Geometric constraints**: Lamppost corona hypothesis ruled out by observations

### Photoionization Modeling
- **LOC model**: Locally optimally emitting cloud approach producing radial ionization stratification
- **BLR virial factor**: Individual measurements now possible without full reverberation dynamics

## Challenges and Open Questions

1. **BLR complexity**: Rapid changes in geometry and kinematics on year timescales challenge static models
2. **Corona mechanism**: Heating and geometry of disk coronae still not fully understood
3. **Disk instability coupling**: How perturbations and instabilities couple to observable AGN behavior remains unclear
4. **Feedback coupling**: Uncertain mechanical pathways for AGN energy to couple to galactic gas
5. **Early BH growth**: Formation of 10^7-10^8 M☉ black holes in first ~1 Gyr still challenging
