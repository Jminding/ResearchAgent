|-------------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pure Starburst** | 5-20 | <0.05 | 10-500 | N/A | ±0.3 dex |

## III. Unresolved Questions and Research Frontiers

### Outstanding Issues (as of 2024-2025)

1. **X-ray Weakness at High-z**
   - Prevalence: 25-50% of high-z (z > 3) narrow-line AGN reported X-ray weak (Cytowski et al. 2024)
   - Impact: Requires revisions to X-ray luminosity diagnostics; challenges AGN census completeness
   - Future work: XRISM high-resolution spectroscopy, infrared AGN indicators, multi-frequency radio

2. **AGN Feedback Mechanism Ambiguity**
   - Question: Does AGN feedback suppress or enhance host galaxy star formation?
   - Current evidence: Mixed; high-luminosity AGN (L_X > 10^44) show enhanced SFR, possibly selection-biased
   - Needed: Better causal inference; longitudinal studies tracking AGN-driven winds

3. **Compton-Thick AGN Completeness**
   - Limitation: Heavily obscured AGN (N_H > 10^24 cm^-2) underrepresented in X-ray surveys
   - Estimates: 20-50% of AGN may be Compton-thick; variable with redshift
   - Challenge: Standard Fe Kα + reflection diagnostics limited; requires hardness ratio + multi-wavelength confirmation

4. **XRB Population Systematics**
   - Uncertainty: L_X-SFR scaling for XRBs varies factor ~2-3 depending on stellar mass, metallicity, redshift
   - Impact: Complicates starburst host decomposition; introduces ~0.3-0.5 dex error in AGN/starburst separation
   - Solution: Improved X-ray binary spectral models; high-z tests of XRB demographics

5. **Low-Luminosity AGN Classification**
   - Ambiguity: LINER emission can originate from accreting low-mass BHs or starburst shocks
   - Current diagnostic: X-ray spectroscopy relatively insensitive at L_X < 10^40 erg/s
   - Needed: Higher-sensitivity X-ray observations; radio morphology + spectroscopy for accretion confirmation

---

## IV. Recommended Best Practices for Future AGN/Starburst Studies

### Multi-Wavelength Observation Strategy

1. **X-ray Observations** (Essential):
   - Minimum 5 ks exposure for spectral fitting
   - Hard (2-10 keV) + soft (0.5-2 keV) band separation required
   - Fe Kα line detection preferred (requires good spectral resolution)

2. **Optical Spectroscopy** (Essential):
   - Hα, [N II], [O III], Hβ measurements for BPT and X-ray/Hα ratio
   - S/N ≥ 20 per Angstrom for reliable emission-line ratios
   - Spectroscopic redshift for accurate luminosity distances

3. **Infrared Photometry** (Highly Recommended):
   - Multi-band data (WISE, Herschel, AKARI, Spitzer if available)
   - Required for SED fitting and L_IR/L_X diagnostics
   - Far-IR (24-500 μm) essential for starburst SFR calibration

4. **Radio Observations** (Recommended for composite systems):
   - VLA or LOFAR observations detect AGN jets absent in pure starbursts
   - Useful for high-redshift X-ray weak AGN identification
   - Radio morphology distinguishes compact AGN jets from extended starburst emission

### Statistical Analysis Framework

- Report uncertainties (±dex or percentage) explicitly for all derived quantities
- Use Bayesian methods for component separation in composite systems
- Cross-validate results between independent diagnostics; report agreement/disagreement
- Perform sensitivity analysis on SED fitting model assumptions
- For samples >100 objects, use Monte Carlo techniques to propagate uncertainties
